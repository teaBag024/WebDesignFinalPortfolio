To access the web page
1. Unzip the folder
2. Open the web-page in your preferred
browser.(Google Chrome works best!)

Beacause it is interactive,feel free to
click around (^-^).

- Please ignore the .css files, .mp3 (.ogg),
and the "img" folder.
- Please do not delete them because without
them, the images and web styling (and music) do not
show/work.

Thank You!

If there are any issues just email me.
I'll see if I can fix it.
