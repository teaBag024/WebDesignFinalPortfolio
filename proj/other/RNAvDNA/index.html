                              Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA is a double helical polymer that makes up our genetic code. Not only does our genetic code carry instruction for development, functioning, growth and reproduction in our bodies, it is the same for every other living organism. This is true from as tiny as viruses and bacteria, to the largest of animals, the blue whale and even dinosaurs. That being said, it is definitely one of life's most basic building blocks.

                              Found in the nucleus, during interphase, DNA is mostly in a semi-condensed ball called chromatin. However, during mitosis, or meiosis, the splitting of cells, DNA would condense further into Chromosomes. This would allow for easier crossovers and Anaphase, the splitting of the chromosome. It is possible that DNA can be found outside of the DNA. Chloroplasts and Mitochondria each have their own set past down by the female (This later developed into the Endosymbiotic theory).

                              DNA has a backbone that is made of Deoxyribose (pentose-sugar), a phosphate, and its rungs are made of Nitrogenous bases. This entire piece (Backbone, Phosphate, Base) is known as a nucleotide. While it is condensed for, DNA will also contain Histonine to help bind and keep the DNA from breaking.
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              A DNA's nucleotide is the monomer of the DNA polymer. Essentially, this means that many of these nucleotides strung together will make DNA. The same pieces over and over again will not create code that is capable of creating life (It's like a binary sequence with all 0s). Therefore, nucleotides will include some variation in its bases.
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              This variation allows for 4 different bases, Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine. Adenine and Guanine being Purines, the bigger of the Sugars (containing two rings), and Cytosine and Thymine, Pyrimidines, the smaller one ringed base. These Sugars, also known as Nitrogenous Bases connect together to form the rungs of DNA's Helical Ladder. Scientists have found that in the ratios of Nitrogenous Bases, Adenine and Thymine contents are the same, Guanine and Cytosine contents are the same. They concluded that Adenine pairs with Thymine in a weaker double hydrogen bond, and Guanine and Cytosine in a stronger triple hydrogen bond.

                              The previous statement that the Nucleotides were monomers of DNA, and contained three basic parts is the most basic of understandings. The Nucleobases are the Nitrogenous bases as aforementioned. The pentose-sugar, deoxyribose, and the Nucleobase together, forms a Nucleoside. Finally, a phosphate is added to the pentose-sugar's end, thus forming a nucleoside monophosphate.
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              While there are Nucleoside biphosphates, and Nucleoside triphosphates (basically adding extra phosphates to the end), the main focus here is the N.monophosphate. This is because it is here, in the first phosphate that connects two nucleotides together. Alas, the N.biphosphates and the N.triphosphates do have uses, only in the primary DNA Structure, they do not appear. The first phosphate in the N.monophosphate forms a hydroxyl group with the pentose-sugar above. This being that the hydrogen ion of Deoxyribose, and the oxygen of the phosphate group form a covalent bond, betterly known, a hydroxyl group (-OH).
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              These hydroxyl groups bond in a way so that the Deoxyribose, a furanos (five carbon sugar), is pointing its 5th carbon to the top, and 3rd carbon at its bottom (in relation to the oxygen being on top). The 3rd carbon being the one near the hydroxyl group, and the 5th, being the one outside of the ring, and connected to the phosphate group.

While the living R-strand and dead S-strand did nothing to the test mouse, the experiment showed that by injecting both strands into the subject makes the mouse die.

                                        Avery and his team built on top of Griffith's research. With the same experiment, Avery introduced new variables, a Protein Destroying Enzyme and a DNA Destroying Enzyme. The results showed that Transformation occurred even with the Protein Destroying enzyme, but failed with the DNA destroying enzyme. This proved that DNA was responsible for the storage of genetics.

                                        Hershey and Chase inserted bacteriophages into a cell. They did it twice marking different parts of the bacteriophage with radioactive elements. The first one, they marked the proteins with sulfur-35, the second, they marked DNA with phosphorus-32. After injecting the Bacteriophage into separate cells, they noticed that the phosphorus-32 would stay within the nucleus, sulfur-35 didn’t exist proving that DNA was the genetic material.

                              Ribonucleic acid, or RNA is a polymer with many different forms. It contains one strand and can be found in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, the ribosome, and the Endoplasmic reticulum. RNA is one strand of Ribose backbone and nucleotides. It contains Adanine, Guanine, Uracil, and Cytosine (Uracil replacing Thymine). RNA's main function is for Protein Synthesis and Gene Expression. There are three main types of RNA. snRNA, snoRNA, piRNA, miRNA, IncRNA, siRNA, ssRNA, dsRNA, circRNA, and others do exist, but  aren't as well known as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

                              RNA stems from DNA. During a process called RNA Synthesis, RNA is created much like in DNA replication. A RNA polymerase, uses DNA helicase to unwind DNA and read the 3' to 5' DNA strand, adding the correct neucliotide to the growing strand of RNA before closing the Strand of DNA again. This process is also known as Transcription. There are five main different types of RNA polymerase, the first through third being more known. Each RNA polymerase synthesizes different RNA for different purposes, however, all of their functions do link back to Protein synthesis and gene expression.

                              mRNA, or Messenger RNA is the single stranded code that exits the Nucleus to be transcripted into a Protein.

                              Created by RNA Polymerase I and RNA Polymerase II, mRNA has two different forms, mRNA and pre-mRNA. pre-mRNA is mRNA that was just copied from DNA. While in its crude form, pre-mRNA contains parts which will not be expressed called Introns. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA will go through RNA splicing which removes these Introns remaning the Extrons to be expressed in the protein. During RNA splicing, pre-mRNA is also given a cap and a poly-A tail to preserve the now mRNA protecting it from harm on its transport out of the Nucleus.
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              mRNA will bring the Extrons out of the Nucleus and into the Cytoplasm, and Endoplasmic Reticulum for its next step.

                              tRNA or Transfer RNA transfers the amino acids to the growing Polypeptide chain.

                              Synthesized by RNA Polymerase III, tRNA has three loops. the T-loop towards the 3' end, Anticondon loop in the middle, and the D loop towards the 5' end. The Amino Acid will be placed on the 3' end which juts out a little more then the 5' end.
                              <br /><br />
                              <span style = "padding-right: 25px;"></span>
                              On the Anticodon loop, there exist anti-codons. These are the codes that attatch to the mRNA as it is being translated. RNA is read in threes, the three nucleotides being the codons. These condons would code for the different Amino Acids. When the anti-codon of the tRNA matches the codon, that is when it passes its Amino Acid to the polypeptide chain and leaves to be recycled the next time a RNA is translated into Protein.

                              Created by RNA Polymerase III, paired with other proteins, rRNA is used to create Ribosomes. There are two different types of rRNA, the short strand and the long strand, all Ribosomes must have one of each.
                              (How can a ribosome contain proteins when the proteins are synthesized by the ribosomes themselves? Answer, most proteins have been handed down from the female sex cell.)

                              The Ribosome has three binding sites. The A site is where the incoming tRNA binds to the mRNA, and the E site is where the tRNA leaves. The P site in the center is where the tRNA bonds the Amino Acid in a covalent peptied bond to the on growing polypeptide chain.
