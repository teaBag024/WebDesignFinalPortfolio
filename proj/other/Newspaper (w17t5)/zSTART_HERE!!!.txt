For my project I decided to make a web page.

To access said web page
1. left click on "index.html"
2. Open the web-page in your preferred
browser.(Google Chrome works best!)

I made it interactive and added a
couple videos so feel free to
click around (^-^).

- Please ignore the .css files
and the "img" folder.
- Please do not delete them because without
them, the images and web styling do not
show.

Thank You!

If there are any issues just email me.
I'll see if I can fix it.
