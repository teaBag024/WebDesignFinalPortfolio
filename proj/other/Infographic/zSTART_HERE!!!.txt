For our project we decided to make an infographic.
Because I(Lilian) had the deplorable idea of
making it interactable, we made a web page.

To access said web page
1. Unzip the folder
2. Open the web-page in your preferred
browser.(Google Chrome works best!)

Beacause it is interactive,feel free to
click around (^-^).

- Please ignore the .css files
and the "img" folder.
- Please do not delete them because without
them, the images and web styling do not
show.

Thank You!

If there are any issues just email me.
I'll see if I can fix it.
