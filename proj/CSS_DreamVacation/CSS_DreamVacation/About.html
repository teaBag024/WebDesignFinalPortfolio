              below. Acadia has 27 miles of historic motor roads, 158 miles of hiking trails, and 45 miles of carriage roads. So be prepared to hike a lot.
              Acadia's mountains are also made of granite. As pretty as it is, granite is quite slippery when wet, so please wear apropriate shoes when hiking.
              Acadia also has amazing tide pools, it is a good idea to wear some type of water shoes becasue the stones can be sharp.
