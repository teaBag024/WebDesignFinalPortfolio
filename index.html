                    <span></span>Web and Design is a course to learn the basic forms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Taught at Downingtown East Highschool by Mrs. Engard, Web and design is a fantastic buissness encore class to try out the edges of this growing work field.

                    <cite>
                         "This course offers students the opportunity to express themselves creatively on the internet through self-published websites. They will utilize criteria to evaluate and analyze web pages in a variety of fields to create their own functional, engaging websites that encourage multiple visits. It familiarizes them with attractive and interactive design strategies. Topics include effective use of color, page design, navigation, publishing, and maintaining websites. Students will develop a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."

                         <span></span> I personally loved this course. It showed me my limits in patience and it taught me how to problem solve my way around tricky area. This course and the projects it presented helped me develop a stronger sense of logic and a different way of approaching things.
                         <br><br>
                         <span></span>As a student who considers persuing CS as a future career, I honestly think learning the basics of <i>HTML, CSS, </i>and <i>JavaScript</i> helps me re-think ways to comunicate to the compiler, and develop new ways of thinking and doing things.

I'd like to thank Mrs. Engard for enduring my endless pestering whenever I have questions and my stubborness and lack of code orginazation. Despite only been in "in-person" school for two weeks this year, I had a lot of fun in this class.

                                   For this project, I actually had noticed an embed feature on youtube and wanted to try it out. This was before learning how to embed multimedia. I wrote about January 5th, "insurrection" at the White House.

                              <p> For this project, my partner and I made an infographic on smoking. Because it was much easier for me to customize our page, and add an interactive layer to it, I created a website based of of the ParrallexScrolls template.</p>

Their websites as displayed are the product of procrastination and last minute panic. If it weren't for Webtoons and other manga, Lilian would cease to exist. Other than being lazy and having existental crisies, Lilian completed DASD's Web and Design course this school year, 2020-2021. Through these unprecidented times they managed to make it through virtual school and their first year of HighSchool.
